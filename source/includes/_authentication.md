# Authentication

> Pass a Bearer token in an Authorization header.

```shell
$ curl 'https://app.sunlight.is/endpoint' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer {key}'
```

Authentication is done through the API key that will be provided by sunlight support.

Requests are authenticated passing your API key as a bearer token in a authorization header.
